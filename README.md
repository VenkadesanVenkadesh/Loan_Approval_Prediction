# Loan_Approval_Prediction

**Step 1: Problem Definition**

     - Define the problem: Predicting Loan approval for the customer

**Step 2: Data Collection**

       - Collect a dataset containing relevant customer information
            
**Step 3: Data Preprocessing**

       - Clean and preprocess the dataset:
       
           - Handle missing values
           
           - Normalize data
           
           - Convert categorical variables into numerical variables

**Step 4: Feature Selection**

       - Select relevant features to use in the model

**Step 5: Model Selection**

       - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm:
       
              - Classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, svm, knn, naive bayes)

**Step 6: Model Training**

         - Train the model using the selected features and algorithm: 
         
              - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   

**Step 7: Model Evaluation**

        - Evaluate the performance of the model:
        
    - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
    
    - Compare the performance of different models

    -visualize the data via plots for better understanding
